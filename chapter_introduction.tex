    \addsec{First computers}%
    \label{sec:first_computers}

        % TODO talk about the human computers, followed by the first (machine) computer created by Cray and IBM, also
        % Von Neuman, analog computers, etc.

    \addsec{Exponential growth}%
    \label{sec:exponential_growth}

        % TODO Moore's law, huge performance gains, helped to get great scientifical breakthrough
        % Not terminated yet, we "need" to go further. Side note: when will it be enough? Question of the environmental
        % impact (we make great progress in terms of efficiency, like flops/W, but the growth is even faster (so for
        % instance the total consumptions are still increasing)).

            Both the platform performance and their total number of cores have seen an exponential increase, whereas the CPU
            frequencies have reached a plateau since 15 years}

    \addsec{Increased complexity}%
    \label{sec:increased_complexity}

        % TODO increased complexity everywhere (HW and SW), deterministic at micro-level but the macro-level is random
        % no complete understanding of the whole thing, we need experimental CS, we need models (very similarly to what
        % is done in physics or biology)
        Some horror stories\cite{Petrini_2003}\dots
